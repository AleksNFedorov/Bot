# Bot

Bot is a small application to help keep an eye over network resources using variety predefined checks and same time be extensible for custom needs. 

In a broad context app might be used as a scheduler for any kind of tasks

## Project goals
1. Provide easy way to check network resource availability with different checks
  * Ping
  * Http
  * Trace
2. Make it runnable on major OS: Windows, Mac OS, *nix
3. Easy customizable and manageable

### Use case

(clickable)
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AleksNFedorov/Bot/docs/docs/img/use_case_diagramm.png" width="370" />

## Features 

* Set of predefined checks: Ping, HTTP, Trace
* Command line interface
* Configuration with XML config
* Modular design (just add jar with custom executors and/or reports to classpath)
* API for custom checks and reporting

## Getting started

### Create config file

```xml
<config>
    <!-- Task group config -->
    <group id="GitHub.com">
        <!--
            'gitHubPing' task, runs every 10 seconds with PING executor,
            execution deadline - 3 secs
        -->
        <task id="gitHubPing" executor="PING">
            <run>10</run>
            <deadline>3</deadline>
    </task>
        <!--
            'gitHubTrace' task, runs every 30 seconds with TRACE executor,
            execution deadline - 10 secs
        -->
        <task id="gitHubTrace" executor="TRACE">
            <run>30</run>
            <deadline>10</deadline>
        </task>
    </group>
    <!--
        Un grouped 'Java.com' task, runs every 2 seconds with CUSTOM_EX executor,
        execution deadline - 1 secs
        Contains extra parameters for executor in executorConfig node
    -->
    <task id="Java.com" executor="CUSTOM_EX">
        <run>2</run>
        <deadline>1</deadline>
        <executorConfig>
            <property key="key">value</property>
        </executorConfig>
    </task>
   <!--
       Un grouped 'runOnce' task
       Runs only once with CUSTOM_ONE_RUN executor
   -->
   <task id="runOnce" executor="CUSTOM_ONE_RUN">
       <run>-1</run>
   </task>    
</config>
```

### Build project

#### Build core module (Step 1)

```cmd
#Build common module
cd <project_path>/common
mvn install

#Build worker module
cd <project_path>/worker
mvn install
```

#### Build moudules with checkes (Step 2)

`Not implemented yet`

#### Build custom modules `if any` (Step 3)

Build modules with custom checks and reports, look into [sample](https://github.com/AleksNFedorov/Bot/tree/master/sample) project for more info

1. To add custom check
 * Implement [TaskExecutor](https://github.com/AleksNFedorov/Bot/blob/master/common/src/main/java/com/bot/common/TaskExecutor.java)
 * Annotate it with [AutoService](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/service)
2. To add custom report
 * Implement [TaskResultProcessor](https://github.com/AleksNFedorov/Bot/blob/master/common/src/main/java/com/bot/common/TaskResultProcessor.java)
 * Annotate it with [AutoService](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/service)

## Run project

###Windows
``` cmd
java -cp "worker.jar;checks.jar;custom.jar" com.bot.worker.BotStarter --task-config-file=<path to config file>

```
###Unix 
``` cmd
java -cp "worker.jar:checks.jar:custom.jar" com.bot.worker.BotStarter --task-config-file=<path to config file>
```

###Where 

* worker.jar - artifact from Step 1
* checks.jar - artifact from Step 2
* checks.jar - artifact from Step 3
* <path to config file> - path to tasks XML config

### Important

``` cmd
Do not expect ouput in console, it is used for Command line interface
```


## Beta notice

Bot is still under development. Core functionality already implemented and not significant code change expecting, however some minor changes are likely. Stay tuned.
